## Introduction
NoSQL databases provide a flexible, scalable, and high-performance solution for managing large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Unlike traditional SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema and can handle a wide variety of data models, making them ideal for modern applications.

## Database Types

### Document Stores
- **MongoDB**: A popular, open-source document-oriented database.
- **CouchDB**: A database that uses JSON to store data and JavaScript as its query language.

### Key-Value Stores
- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- **DynamoDB**: A fully managed proprietary NoSQL database service provided by Amazon.

### Column Stores
- **Cassandra**: A highly scalable database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers.
- **HBase**: A distributed, scalable, big data store, modeled after Google's Bigtable.

### Graph Databases
- **Neo4j**: A graph database management system with an emphasis on high-performance graph traversal.
- **ArangoDB**: A multi-model database with support for graph, document, and key-value data models.
